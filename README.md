What is Destructuring and Spread in JavaScript..?
    
    Object destructuring and Spread syntax are not the same thing.

    Spread syntax (also known as the Spread Operator) is used to copy the enumerable properties of an object to create a clone of it.
    We can also update an object or merge with another object using the spread syntax.

    The Rest parameter is kind of the opposite of the Spread syntax. It helps to consolidate (or collect) the remaining object properties
    into a new object while destructuring is done.
